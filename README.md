# Fighter++
A text-based fighter game with a non-ATB turn-based battle system made for my final project in the Programmering 1 class in GÃ¶teborgsregionens Teknsiska Gymnasium. The project includes arrow-based navigation and text input instead of the normal input choice seen in most games. Vaguely inspired by [an unfinished project I did in 8th grade](https://replit.com/@Sleipners/mono-rpg).

## Getting started
- Get the code:
  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/youknowedo/FighterPlusPlus.git
  ```
- Open [/Fighter.sln](/Fighter.sln) in Visual Studio to build and run the app.
